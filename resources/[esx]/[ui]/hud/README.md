# Minimalistic FiveM HUD V2.

        Plug and play since: 2021/06/29

- FiveM HUD built with React + Typescript. Design was used from another HUD. Only way to edit the HUD for personal likings is only done within SCSS. Will make a more easily configurable HUD in the future.

**Guide on how to start editing the HUD:**

1.  Navigate to the **ui** folder within the resource and run the command bellow to install the necessary packages.

        npm install

2.  Once all of the necessary packages are installed, you can run the code bellow to run a development server to edit the HUD.

        npm run start

3.  Or you can run the code bellow to build a production version for you FiveM server.

        npm run build

### HUD is free of use, but I would appreciate it if you leave a credit when personalising or editing this.
