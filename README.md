# I-BASE-V1-FINAL

I made this simple base using es_extended 1 final (like 1.2) to bring a dev server, It works perfectly to develop and improve it if you follow the installation steps. üòè

# How to install

First set your key (https://keymaster.fivem.net) <br>
Set your SteamApiKey <br>
Set your FiveM ID to admin perms in cfg ( ex: add_principal identifier.fivem:00000 )  <br>
Set the database path and use (MysqlServer or MariaBD recommendation, not Xampp :)) <br>
Put the path in the run.cmd <br>
In the first one put the artifacts, recommendation to put them in a folder called "dlls" in C: (The recommended ones) <br>

# Extra

All the scripts used are free and open source, extracted from the FiveM forum, (ESX-FRAMEWORK).

# More

This is a basic base to start developing your server developed in final V1 (1.2). <br>
This is not a ready sell base or Super base to run your server directly, i recomend to use if you want to start your base for your RP server.
Recomend to use with txadmin.
