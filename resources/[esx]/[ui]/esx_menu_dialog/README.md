# esx_menu_dialog

Description:

Clean and simple design, consisting of a redisign of the esx_menu_dialog from the esx-framework, however with an inspiration of the NoPixel 3.0 similar menu. If you edit it a better way, feel free to ask for a pull request on the Github repository on the link below. Regardless, I Hope you Enjoy It!
