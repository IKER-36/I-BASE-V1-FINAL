```
`EMBED_MESSAGE`: This will be the message send in the top of the embed.<br>
`PLAYER_ID`: This will send the player to the script to get the info. (This needs to be a server id)<br>
`PLAYER_2_ID`: This will send the second player's to the script to get the info. (This needs to be a server id)<br>

2. Create a discord channel with webhook and add this to the webhooks.
```
local webhooks = {
	all = "DISCORD_WEBHOOK",
	chat = "DISCORD_WEBHOOK",
	joins = "DISCORD_WEBHOOK",
	leaving = "DISCORD_WEBHOOK",
	deaths = "DISCORD_WEBHOOK",
	shooting = "DISCORD_WEBHOOK",
