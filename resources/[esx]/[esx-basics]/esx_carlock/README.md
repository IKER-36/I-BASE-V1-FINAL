# esx_carlock

This is another kind of carlock script. You need es_extended (https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended) and esx_vehicleshop (https://github.com/ESX-Org/esx_vehicleshop) to make it work. U to lock/unlock your vehicle. You can lock it even if multiple vehicles are near you and your vehicle is not the closest one. If you have multiple vehicles that you own out, it'll lock the closest. Showcase (added an animation when you lock/unlock your vehicle) : https://youtu.be/lzvkP8heivw The default radius is 30, you can change it in the clienten.lua or clientfr.lua. This script is available in two languages, english and french, it is in english by default. Change the clienten.lua to clientfr.lua in __resource.lua if you want it in french. Do not re-upload it without asking me first please.
